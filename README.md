# SecRC Mobile Application

## What's this about?

This is the flutter-based mobile application used to control the [SecRC Controller device](https://github.com/adrian-dobre/SecRC-Controller). It can perform
all the functions that the SEC-RC Control Panel can perform plus monitoring temperature, relative humidity, pressure and CO2 levels.

## Why do it?

Well, due to a few of reasons:
1. As of right now, there is no "smart" (connected) solution offered by the manufacturer for the RC variant of the Sevi-160 Heat-Recovery Ventilation System
2. It makes sense to combine the "controller" with a Weather Station - this can allow creating automations without having to purchase separate sensors
3. I like controlling my devices from my phone.
